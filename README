This directory contains everything necessary to run the Microservices Pipeline demo.
It comes in two variants: an HQ version and an EDGE version.
The HQ version is standalone. Use this by itself to demonstrate microservice architectures.
The Edge version can only work in conjunction with the HQ version, using two clusters to demonstrate data replication.

Run install-demo-<variant>.sh to install the demo.

Then, run the app using run-<variant>Dashboard.sh.
Follow the instructions to establish a connection from a web browser.

With the demo already installed, modifications to the demo app (i.e. HTML, javascript, and/or back-end Java code) can be deployed using the webonly.sh script.
