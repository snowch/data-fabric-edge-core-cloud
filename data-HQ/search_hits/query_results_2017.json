Access to the spacecraft is needed for compatibility testing to verify communication with a tracking station in Hawaii. With the change in the launch timeframe to June, this station will be needed to support launch. After processing of Orbital\u2019s Pegasus XL rocket and the spacecraft are complete, they will be flown on Orbital's L-1011 carrier aircraft from Vandenberg to the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on the Pacific Ocean\u2019s Kwajalein Atoll for launch.  The high-energy X-ray telescope will conduct a census of black holes, map radioactive material in young supernovae remnants, and study the origins of cosmic rays and the extreme physics around collapsed stars.

Astronauts Eric Boe and Suni Williams tried on the new suits, which were unveiled Jan. 25. In addition to meeting NASA\u2019s requirements for safety and functionality, the new design weighs less and is more comfortable than earlier versions.

Research divers and an autonomous kayak monitored coral color signatures from the ocean floor and surface, while NASA\u2019s high-altitude ER-2 collected images of the same areas from a height of 70,000 ft. The data from these sources are being combined to better understand how coral reef ecosystems are responding to stressful conditions like warming ocean temperatures and water acidification. Data from this mission will potentially help develop a NASA satellite to study natural hazards and ecosystems all over the world.

The Swarmies then move the cubes to a white square in the center of the completion arena. The small, four-wheeled robots are designed to effectively and efficiently locate hidden resources while astronauts explore distant destinations such as the moon or Mars.",
