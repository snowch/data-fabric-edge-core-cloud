Lewis researchers conducted a wide variety of studies on ramjets to determine basic the operational data necessary to design missiles. Extensive wind tunnel and test stand studies were augmented by actual flight tests.     Lewis engineers modified this B‒29 so that the ramjet could be stored in the bomb bay. Once the aircraft reached the desired altitude and speed, a mechanical arm suspended the ramjet 52 inches below the bomb bay. The ramjet’s angle-of-attack could be independently adjusted, and a periscope permitted a view of the test article from inside the aircraft. Researchers took measurements in free-stream conditions at speeds up to Mach 0.51 and at altitudes ranging from 5,000 to 30,000 feet. They then shut the ramjet down and retracted it into the aircraft.    The researchers first determined that 14,000 feet was the maximum altitude at which the engine could be ignited by spark. They used flares to start the engine at altitudes up to 30,000 feet.  They were able to determine maximum combustion efficiencies, response time to changes in fuel flow, and minimum fuel-air ratios. Overall the ramjet operated well at all speeds and altitudes."}],"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1948-C-21990/collection.json","links":[{"render":"image","rel":"preview","href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1948-C-21990/GRC-1948-C-21990~thumb.jpg"}]},{"data":[{"center":"MSFC","search_term": "tsunami","media_type":"image","date_created":"1960-11-03T00:00:00Z","title":"Wernher von Braun","nasa_id":"7776414","keywords":["von Braun","Medaris","Army Ballistic Missile Agency","ABMA"],"description":"Marshall Space Flight Center’s (MSFC) Director, Dr. Wernher von Braun, is pictured here with Army Ballistic Missile Agency’s (ABMA) Commanding General, J.B.

The Redstone engine was a modified and improved version of the Air Force's Navaho cruise missile engine of the late forties. The A-series, as this would be known, utilized a cylindrical combustion chamber as compared with the bulky, spherical V-2 chamber. By 1951, the Army was moving rapidly toward the design of the Redstone missile, and the production was begun in 1952. Redstone rockets became the \"reliable workhorse\" for America's early space program.
