# Convenience script to download OpenVPN keys from server
# and copy them to the Sandbox.

# Run this script from your MacBook.

# These are the required files:
# /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/ca.crt
# /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/sandbox.crt
# /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/sandbox.key
# /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/azureGateway.crt
# /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/azureGateway.key
# /etc/openvpn/myvpn.tlsauth

# Those keys were probably owned by root and canâ€™t be downloaded directly.
# You can run a script on the AWS server to consolidate them all 
# into a temporary directory accessible by ec2-user.
# Specify that temporary location using AWS_KEYS_LOCATION.
